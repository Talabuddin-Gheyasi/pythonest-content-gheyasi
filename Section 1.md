# PCEP-30-02 1.1: Understand Fundamental Terms and Definitions

## Interpreting and the Interpreter
**1. Interpreter**: An interpreter is a program that executes other programs directly, translating high-level programming languages into machine code line-by-line at runtime. This allows for easier debugging and immediate execution of code.

**Example:** Python uses an interpreter, allowing you to run code interactively:

'''python title="Example"
print("Hello, World!")
'''

## 2. Compilation and the Compiler
Compiler: A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code before execution. This process usually results in faster execution because the code is precompiled.

**Example:** C/C++ uses compilers. For instance, if you have a C program:
'''python title="Example"
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
'''

## 3. Lexis ##
Lexis: This refers to the vocabulary of a programming language, including keywords, operators, and identifiers. Lexical elements include identifiers like variable names and reserved keywords.

**Example:** In Python, keywords include if, else, def, etc.

## 4. Syntax ##
Syntax: The rules that define the structure of statements in a programming language. Syntax errors occur when code violates these rules.

**Example:** In Python, a function definition must include a colon:
'''python title="Example"
def my_function():  # Correct syntax
    pass
'''
## 5. Semantics ##
Semantics: The meaning of the statements in a programming language. While syntax defines the structure, semantics defines the behavior of the code.

**Example:** The statement x = 5 assigns the integer value 5 to the variable x. The semantics explains what happens during execution.

**Questions:**

Multiple Choice: What is the main function of an interpreter?

A) To execute the program line-by-line
B) To compile the entire program before execution
C) To identify syntax errors
D) To convert machine code to high-level code

True/False: A compiler can detect runtime errors before the program is executed.

Answer: False (compilers can detect syntax errors but not runtime errors).

Code Compilation: What type of error does the following code produce?

'''python title="Example"
if (x > 10)
    print("x is greater than 10")
'''

    print("Hello!")
'''
**Answer:** SyntaxError (missing colon after function definition).

**Multiple Choice:** In which of the following languages is the term "interpreter" most commonly used?
A) C++
B) Java
C) Python
D) Assembly
**Answer:** C) Python

**True/False:** Syntax errors prevent a program from running until they are fixed.

**Answer:** True

**Code Compilation:** Given the following code, what type of error will it generate?
'''python title="Example"
for i in range(5)
    print(i)

'''

    return 3 + 5
print(my_func())
'''

B) 8
C) my_func
D) None
**Answer:** B) 8


# PCEP-30-02 1.2: Understand Pythonâ€™s Logic and Structure #
## 1. Keywords ##
**Definition:**
Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning. They cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names) because they are integral to the syntax and functionality of the language.

**Examples:**
if, else, elif: Used for conditional statements.
for, while: Used for loops.
def: Used to define a function.
import: Used to include modules.

'''python title="Example"
Copy code
def check_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(check_even(10))  # Output: True
'''

**Questions:**
Multiple Choice: Which of the following is a Python keyword?

A) variable

2. Instructions
Definition:
Instructions are commands that tell the Python interpreter what to do. They can perform actions such as calculations, data manipulation, and control flow.

Examples:

Assignment: x = 10
Function call: print("Hello")
Control flow: if, for, while statements.
Example Code:

python

number = 5
if number > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Negative or Zero")

Copy code
x = 5
print(x * 2)
Answer: 10

Multiple Choice: Which of the following instructions will cause an error?

A) y = 10

3. Indentation
Definition:
Indentation is the whitespace at the beginning of a line that determines the structure and grouping of code blocks in Python. Unlike many languages that use braces, Python uses indentation to define code blocks.

Examples:

Indentation is required after control statements like if, for, and while.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
for i in range(3):
    print(i)  # This line is indented, indicating it is part of the loop.

B) It defines the scope of code blocks.
C) It is not required.
D) It makes the code run faster.
Answer: B) It defines the scope of code blocks.

True/False: Indentation can be done using both spaces and tabs interchangeably in Python.

Answer: False

Code Compilation: What error does this code produce?

python
Copy code
if True:
print("True")
Answer: IndentationError

D) 8
Answer: C) 4

True/False: Indentation is optional in Python.

Answer: False

Code Compilation: What is the output of the following code?

Answer: True (but it may lead to errors if not consistent).

Code Compilation: What will this code output?

python
Copy code
def my_function():
    print("Start")
    print("End")

my_function()

sql
Copy code
Start
End

C) Using varying spaces for different lines
D) Not using any indentation
Answer: B) Consistently using 4 spaces for all indents

4. Comments
Definition:
Comments are annotations in the code that are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to explain the code, making it easier to understand.

Examples:

Single-line comments start with #.
Multi-line comments can be enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''').
Example Code:

python
Copy code
# This is a single-line comment
def my_function():
    """This function prints a message."""
    print("Hello, World!")

my_function()

B) Using # on each line
C) Using """ or '''
D) Using /* ... */
Answer: C) Using """ or '''

True/False: Comments can help improve code readability.

Answer: True

Code Compilation: What is the output of the following code?
